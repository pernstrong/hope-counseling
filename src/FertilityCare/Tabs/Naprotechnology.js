        <p>
          Based on over thirty years of research and practical application,
          NaProTECHNOLOGY (Natural Procreative Technology) is a women&#39;s
          health science which has, as its main principle, the ability to work
          cooperatively with the woman&#39;s menstrual and fertility cycle.
          NaProTECHNOLOGY relies on the CREIGHTON MODEL FertilityCare System
          (CrMS) biomarkers to monitor easily and objectively the occurrence of
          various hormonal events during the menstrual cycle. CrMS provides
          valid information that can be interpreted by a woman and by physicians
          who are specifically trained in this system.
        </p>
        <p>
          NaProTECHNOLOGY is the first women&#39;s health science to network
          family planning with reproductive health monitoring and gynecologic
          health maintenance unlike common artificial and suppressive
          approaches. This is a fertility-care based medical approach rather
          than a fertility-control approach that provides medical and surgical
          treatments.
        </p>
        <p>
          NaProTECHNOLOGY identifies the problems and cooperates with the
          menstrual and fertility cycles that correct the condition, maintain
          the human ecology, and sustain the procreative potential. It has many
          applications, including family planning, the evaluation and treatment
          of infertility and other reproductive disorders, abnormal bleeding,
          abnormal hormone conditions of the menstrual cycle including
          premenstrual syndrome and recurrent ovarian cysts, the dating and
          beginning of pregnancy, and postpartum depression.

            NaProTECHNOLOGY, using the CREIGHTON MODEL FertilityCare System
            (CrMS) as a foundation, can be used to treat many health issues,
