        <p>
          Every woman has the right to know how her menstrual and fertility
          cycles function in order to understand the way her body works.
          Unfortunately, most women have not been provided with this
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The
          <span className="bold">
            CREIGHTON MODEL FertilityCare System (CrMS)
          </span>
          is based upon the knowledge and understanding of the
          naturally-occurring phases of a woman&#39;s fertility and infertility.
          CrMS relies upon the standardized observation and charting of
          biological markers that are essential to a woman&#39;s gynecological
          and reproductive health. Now, a woman can know her cycles and use this
          information for the maintenance of her health. Further, couples can
          use this knowledge to plan their family and build their future
          together.
        </p>
        <p>
          In CrMS, fertility is observed as a part of health, not disease. It is
          a system that is specifically not a natural contraceptive. Rather, it
          is a true method of family planning… a method that can be used in two
          ways, to achieve, as well as, avoid pregnancy. These principles make
          this system distinctly different from contraception, artificial or
          natural.

        <p className="bold">What are the advantages of the Creighton Model?</p>
        <p>
          The advantages of the CREIGHTON MODEL FertilityCare System (CrMS) are
          numerous, including the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>CrMS is natural</li>
          <li>
            CrMS is safe - There are no known medical side effects associated
            with its use
          </li>
          <li>CrMS is inexpensive</li>
          <li>CrMS is 96.8-99.5% effective for avoiding pregnancy</li>
          <li>
            CrMS is 76-98% effective for achieving pregnancy in couples of
            normal fertility
          </li>
          <li>
            CrMS allows a woman to monitor and maintain both her gynecological
            and reproductive health
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Another important advantage of CrMS is it is a shared method of
          fertility regulation. The responsibility for its use is placed equally
          upon both spouses. To use this system successfully, it is necessary to
          make accurate observations and to chart them correctly. In addition,
          one must follow the instructions of the system which depend upon the
          couple’s decision to either achieve or avoid pregnancy. Also, the
          couple should be mutually motivated in its use and enter into it with
          a loving and cooperative spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike contraceptives, CrMS treats fertility as a normal and healthy
          process. It does not treat fertility as a disease. The challenge to
          live in harmony with one’s fertility is often one of the most exciting
          and meaningful aspects in the use of this system. Most couples find
          that the love and respect each holds for the other grows as their
          understanding and appreciation of their fertility increases. It is a
          system that is firmly based in a respect for human life, human
          dignity, and the integrity of marriage. Indeed, it is the couples who
          use this system and their families that benefit from this experience.
