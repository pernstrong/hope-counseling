        What is Hope? Hope is to desire with expectation of obtainment. Hope is
        to cherish a desire with anticipation. Hope is to expect with
        confidence. Hope is a feeling in desire. Hope is something you really
        want and need. Hope is a feeling that makes you feel that the next day
        will be better. Hope is knowing that goals can be achieved and goals
        give people momentum to keep living. Hope is different than wishful
        thinking. Hope sees the real and hard obstacles on the path to reaching
        goals, but it motivates us to stick with it. Hope is being able to see
        that there is LIGHT despite the darkness.
