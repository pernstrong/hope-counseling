        Hi and Welcome! If you’re here, on this page, you may be at a point in
        your journey where something has come up that you’d like help working
        through. Many choose me to be their therapist if they are looking for a
        Catholic Christian therapist. Although my own faith is why I do what I
        do, I never force faith or prayer into counseling sessions, but allow
        clients to choose how integrating faith (or not) may be of help for
        their sessions.
      </p>

        My journey to helping others began in my teenage years, and I began
        leadership programs in high school. These programs helped me form as a
        leader, learn the importance of giving of myself to others, and most
        importantly, how much people matter. A midwestern girl at my core, I
        have lived and traveled and seen how much knowing who we are and whose
        we are helps us each to become the very best version of ourselves.

        I studied Social Work at Texas Christian University and Franciscan
        University of Steubenville and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in
        Social Work. I obtained my Master’s in Social work at the Catholic
        University of America in Washington, DC. Having faith integrated into my
        curriculum and degrees further enhanced my own healing and prepared me
        to be a better Catholic Christian counselor.

        I have been in your shoes, looking for a Catholic therapist. We all have
        things, whether it&#39;s from childhood or in recent years, that we may
        need help navigating through, to find healing and hope. As a Catholic
        therapist, my faith is at the core of who I am and what I do. Every
        session is given to the Holy Spirit, I am just the vessel. If you&#39;re
        looking for healing and hope, please contact me for a free 15 min
        &#39;meet and greet.&#39; This gives you and I a chance to see if
        we&#39;re a good fit, as you truly want to find a therapist who you feel
        comfortable with and who you connect with to work through whatever life
        difficulties have brought you here. Our Catholic faith is a true gift in
        the counseling process, as we are one - body, mind a spirit - and so to
        separate our faith from our healing process would do us a disservice.
        Integrating the Catholic faith into my client&#39;s processes is what
        brings me great joy, allowing the Divine Healer to truly work in the
        ways He desires.
