        <p className="bold">Curious about Brainspotting?</p>
        <p>
          Brainspotting is a powerful, focused treatment method that works by
          identifying, processing and releasing core neurophysiological sources
          of emotional/body pain, trauma, dissociation and a variety of other
          challenging symptoms. Clients experiencing Brainspotting can look
          forward to integrating healing on emotional, somatic, psychological,
          spiritual, and physical levels.

        <p className="bold">What is Brainspotting?</p>
        <p>
          The motto of Brainspotting is “where you look affects how you feel.”
          Our eyes and brains are intricately woven together and signals sent
          from the eyes are deeply processed in the brain which then reflexively
          and intuitively redirects where we look. Trauma can overwhelm the
          brain’s processing capacity, leaving behind pieces of the trauma,
          frozen in an unprocessed state. Brainspotting uses our field of vision
          to find where we are holding these traumas, scanning the inside
          environments, seeking the specific internal spot where the trauma is
          stored. It then allows deep processing to release and resolve the
          trauma. The Brainspotting therapist listens to the client’s words and
          body experiences, observing the eyes, face and body, watching for
          reflexive cues. It is based on the premise that the brain is
          self-healing and the role of the therapist is to set and hold a frame
          that promotes the client’s self-healing capacities.

        <p className="bold">Is Brainspotting only for trauma?</p>
        <p>
          No. Brainspotting was founded by working with trauma clients, but it
          is uniquely effective is addressing all kinds of brain/body/emotional
          problems. It is used with high-performance athletes, stage, film and
          TV actors, addiction, loss and grief.

        <p className="bold">Is Brainspotting safe?</p>
        <p>
          Absolutely. Brainspotting therapists know that the only solutions to
          the problems clients bring to the therapy office lie within the
          clients themselves. Brainspotting encompasses a full spectrum of
          possible interventions, according to the clients need, from the most
          activated to the most resourced use of eye position and body
          experience. It is specifically and intentionally designed to be
          integrated with other therapy methods. Clients will not lose the
          memories of life events, they will be freed from the negative feelings
          associated with the events.
