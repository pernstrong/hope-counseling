          Friends, sometime even just acquaintances, know that if I find
          something worth sharing, I will! I am often known to be sharing an
          awesome recipe I found via text to friends I know will enjoy it. I
          send faith formation ideas for kids when I come across ones we’ve
          loved. I share good books, especially spiritual or parenting, with
          those in my life. While in graduate school in DC, I had a core group
          of girlfriends who really encouraged each other in eating healthy and
          switching out toxic products for cleaner options. I began using clean
          shampoos, conditioners, lotions, etc. But I never consistently washed
          my face. I know! I was that girl.

          My health journey took some unforeseen twists and turns when my
          husband and I began to try to conceive our first a few years into our
          marriage. As I learned I had hormone problems, thyroid problems, and
          endometriosis, I dove into researching these and why/what the
          underlying root causes could be. I began continuing the ditches and
          switches in all areas of my life – cleaning products, laundry, etc.
          But I still didn’t consistently wash my face. And I thankfully had
          fairly healthy skin so I didn’t have to wear foundation to cover up.

          A few years ago I finally took the leap and decided I would commit to
          taking care of my face, investing in another company’s products. While
          I liked a few, I was disappointed by most. It wasn’t until last fall,
          2021, when I jumped ship from BeautyCounter to Crunchi, that my life
          changed. I literally haven’t missed a day washing my face and doing my
          clean skincare routine morning AND night since I began. I look forward
          to it! Can you believe that? I’m now well into my 30s and FINALLY wash
          my face! And I love to do it. I also absolutely love Crunchi’s
          make-up. While I’m fairly low maintenance and don’t wear much make-up,
          I love how it feels. It doesn’t irritate my skin or my eyes, and it
          looks beautiful. So here I am, continuing to do what I do, sharing
          something I LOVE. One of the things I love most about Crunchi was,
          shortly after beginning to use their products, I listened to a
          recorded talk with one of the founders and one thing she said struck
          me – she said (paraphrased), “Our mission was never to become this
          huge business. If we impacted someone in a way, such as what they
          would choose to buy at the grocery store, making healthier choices,
          then it was worth it.” How cool is that? Because ultimately all of our
          goals is to live the healthiest lives we can, right? So, my choice for
          clean skincare definitely infiltrates other areas of my life. And,
          actually, for me, other areas of my clean journey infiltrated my
          skincare and make up last. But the point is that if we want clean
          skincare products, we have to choose healthier, cleaner cleaning
          products, foods, laundry detergent, etc. Crunchi is not only clean,
          but it performs! I told a friend after a women’s weightlifting class,
          “Oh my gosh, I have foundation stains on my shirt from wiping my face
          on my shirt after it got sweaty at class. And it’s a good thing!
          Because I put my foundation on at 7:30am and my workout class was at
          7pm! So 12 hours later, my foundation was still on well enough to
          stain my shirt!” And yes, the stain came out!
